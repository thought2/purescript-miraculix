# `miraculix-lite`

This is an autogenerated version of `miraculix`.
Here, "lite" means "lite in terms of dependencies". It bundles as many as possible of its own dependencies.
You may consider using this version if you're writing tests for a core package and want to use a testing library which is not heavily depending on other core libraries.
